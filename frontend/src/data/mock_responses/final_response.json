The acceptable resolution time frame is within 90 days; most PDs were resolved efficiently within this period, except for one (ID_9) which took 16 days, still within the acceptable limit. Ongoing PDs (ID_10, ID_11, and ID_22) require close monitoring to ensure timely resolution. Special instruction: prioritize monitoring ongoing PDs to ensure compliance within the 90-day resolution period.\n\n\n=================================== Ai Message ===================================\nName: inspection - user_agent: \n\nInvoking user for validating output from generate_findings_agent.\n\n            Do you approve of the above generated findings?\nType 'y' to continue; otherwise, explain.\n\n            Please specify any rephrasing or formatting \nadjustments you would like.\n\nUser input -> \nUser input -> Human Feedback: y\n\n=================================== Agent Message y===================================================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: inspection - site_area_router: \n\nAll the main-activities are finished, Now generating findings\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: inspection - site_area_agent: \n\nPicked the site area for execution: AE_SAE\n\nGot 1 activities to carry out related to AE_SAE\n  *<activity_id#AE_SAE_001>  Are all AEs/SAEs in final disposition in RAVE, ie. end dates?\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: inspection - data_ingestion node:\n\nIngestion for Site Area: AE_SAE,  trial_id-CNTO1275PUC3001 and site_id-P73-PL10007 is Done!\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: inspection - site_area_router: \n\nInvoking the site area agent for below main activity:\n\n<activity_id#AE_SAE_001> ###  Are all AEs/SAEs in final disposition in RAVE, ie. end dates?\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: inspection - planner_agent:\n\nGenerating sub-activities for: <activity_id#AE_SAE_001> \n\nBelow are the generated sub-activities:\n• What are the adverse events and serious adverse events recorded in RAVE?\n• What are the end dates for each adverse event and serious adverse event?\n• Are all adverse events and serious adverse events in final disposition, i.e., do they have end dates?\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: inspection - critique_agent:\n\nInvoking critique agent for validating sub-activities \nLLM Feedback on sub-activities: \nDo we need to work on feedback-> No,\nWhat is the feedback-> The sub-questions are generally relevant but need to be more specific and logically sequenced.

The acceptable resolution time frame is within 90 days; most PDs were resolved efficiently within this period, except for one (ID_9) which took 16 days, still within the acceptable limit. Ongoing PDs (ID_10, ID_11, and ID_22) require close monitoring to ensure timely resolution. Special instruction: prioritize monitoring ongoing PDs to ensure compliance within the 90-day resolution period.\n",
