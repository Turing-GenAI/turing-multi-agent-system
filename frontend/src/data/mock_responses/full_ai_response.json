This applies to all issues and deviations, including Major Protocol Deviations (PDs), which require timely closure and proper documentation of any delays. There are no variations in the closure time frame based on the type or severity of the protocol deviations, as the 90-day rule applies universally.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Issues and PDs must be closed within 90 days per company policy.\n- If issues or PDs are not closed within 90 days, the reason for the delay must be documented in the Deviation and Issue tracking log.\n\nThis guidance ensures that all protocol deviations are managed promptly and consistently, maintaining compliance and data integrity throughout the clinical trial.\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName:  SelfRAG - self_rag_agent\n\nInvoking Self rag node for the sub-activity: Identify the resolution times for each protocol deviation, compare them to the acceptable time frames, and note any discrepancies.\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName:  SelfRAG - retrieval_agent\n\n\nInvoking: `site_data_retriever_tool` with `{'site_id': 'P73-PL10008', 'trial_id': 'CNTO1275PUC3001', 'site_area': 'PD', 'sub_activity': 'specific protocol deviations reported, including their nature, frequency, and severity'}`\n\n================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: SelfRAG - site_data_retriever tool\n\n\nExecuted Tool: site_data_retriever_tool.

This applies to all issues and deviations, including Major Protocol Deviations (PDs), which require timely closure and proper documentation of any delays. There are no variations in the closure time frame based on the type or severity of the protocol deviations, as the 90-day rule applies universally.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Issues and PDs must be closed within 90 days per company policy.\n- If issues or PDs are not closed within 90 days, the reason for the delay must be documented in the Deviation and Issue tracking log.\n\nThis guidance ensures that all protocol deviations are managed promptly and consistently, maintaining compliance and data integrity throughout the clinical trial.\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName:  SelfRAG - self_rag_agent\n\nInvoking Self rag node for the sub-activity: Identify the resolution times for each protocol deviation, compare them to the acceptable time frames, and note any discrepancies.\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName:  SelfRAG - retrieval_agent\n\n\nInvoking: `site_data_retriever_tool` with `{'site_id': 'P73-PL10008', 'trial_id': 'CNTO1275PUC3001', 'site_area': 'PD', 'sub_activity': 'specific protocol deviations reported, including their nature, frequency, and severity'}`\n\n================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: SelfRAG - site_data_retriever tool\n\n\nExecuted Tool: site_data_retriever_tool.
