If a PD is not closed within this period, the reason must be documented in the Deviation and Issue Tracking Log.\n\n2. **Proper Documentation**:\n   - All actions and offline discussions regarding PDs must be documented and shared with the study team as necessary.\n   - Finalized PD reports must be circulated to relevant study personnel (SRP, SRS, GTL, CTM, IDMM), signed by SRP, and filed in the V-TMF.\n\n3. **Correct Classification**:\n   - The GDM reviews the listing of protocol deviations to ensure correct classification, especially for major PDs, before the database hard lock.\n\n4. **Periodic Review**:\n   - The list of confirmed major PDs is reviewed quarterly with clinical teams to maintain an accurate and up-to-date record.\n\n5. **Final Reporting**:\n   - For studies with an IDM component, the GDM must receive the final list of secure (unblinded) major protocol deviations from the Secure Data Supplier at the end of the study.\n\n6. **Compliance with SOPs and Guidelines**:\n   - The resolution and documentation of PDs must comply with established SOPs, job aids, and training resources provided in the system.\n\nBy adhering to these criteria, the resolution and closure of PDs can be ensured to be acceptable and in line with regulatory and compliance requirements.\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName:  SelfRAG - self_rag_agent\n\nAll the sub-activities are finished.\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: inspection - generate_findings_agent:\n\nGenerating findings for the activity \nHere is the re-generated summary:\n\nConclusion:\nProtocol Deviations (PDs) are effectively identified, documented, managed, and resolved using a structured approach involving specific tools, secure trackers, and periodic reviews.
