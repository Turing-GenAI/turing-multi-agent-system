The first sub-question should specify the type of PDs (Protocol Deviations) being reported. The second sub-question should clarify the source of the acceptable time frame (e.g., regulatory guidelines, internal SOPs). The third sub-question should be more actionable by specifying how to check the time taken (e.g., by reviewing logs or records). Additionally, the sequence should ensure that the identification of PDs comes first, followed by the determination of acceptable time frames, and finally the comparison of actual resolution times against these time frames.\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: inspection - feedback_agent node:\n\nWorking on feedback\nUpdated sub-activities:\n1.
