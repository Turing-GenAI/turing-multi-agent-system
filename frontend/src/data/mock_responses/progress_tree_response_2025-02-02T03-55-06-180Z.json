The first sub-question should specify the type of PDs (Protocol Deviations) being reported. The second sub-question should clarify the acceptable time frame according to which guidelines or standards. The third sub-question should be more actionable by specifying how to check the time taken to resolve/close each PD. Here is a revised version:\n\n1. What types of Protocol Deviations (PDs) have been reported in the clinical trial?\n2. According to the relevant guidelines or standards, what is the acceptable time frame for resolving or closing these types of Protocol Deviations?\n3. For each reported Protocol Deviation, verify if the time taken to resolve or close it falls within the acceptable time frame as per the specified guidelines or standards.\n\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: inspection - feedback_agent node:\n\nWorking on feedback\nUpdated sub-activities:\n1.
