# Compliance Review Backend API

A FastAPI-based backend service for analyzing clinical trial documents against compliance standards. The service uses Azure OpenAI to identify potential compliance issues in clinical trial documents, highlighting exact sentences/paragraphs that may violate regulatory requirements.

## Features

- **Document Compliance Analysis**: Analyze clinical trial documents against compliance standards
- **Smart Text Highlighting**: Identifies specific paragraphs, sentences, or words that violate compliance
- **Confidence Ratings**: Each identified issue includes a confidence rating (high/low)
- **Suggested Edits**: AI provides recommended changes to fix compliance issues
- **Regulation References**: Each issue includes specific regulation citations
