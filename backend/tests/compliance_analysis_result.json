The use of 47 the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or re commended, but 48 not required.",

However, it doesn't provide clear instructions or expectations for quality management or quality assurance and quality control, which are essential parts of the trial's compliance with CFR regulations.",

      "clinical_text": "Washout periods and con comitant medication exclusions are commonly included in cancer clinical trials . However, these exclusions often vary across trials for similar therapeutic classes and diseases and should be appropriate for the trial under consideration. A washout period is a treatment- free period between the most recent anti -cancer treatment and treatment with the investigational drug.",

      "suggested_edit": "Include a statement that outlines the procedures for determining and implementing a premature termination or suspension of the trial. For example, 'In the event that significant safety concerns arise during the washout period or consequently from concomitant medication exclusions, the trial may be prematurely terminated or suspended following the procedure outlined in 21 CFR 312.50 for the safety and well-being of the trial subjects.'",
