Appendix A. INVESTIGATOR’S BROCHURE

A.1 Introduction

The Investigator’s Brochure (IB) provides clinical and nonclinical data relevant to the investigational product(s) under study in human participants. Its purpose is to assist investigators and trial staff in understanding key protocol elements, including dosage, administration methods, and safety monitoring.

A.1.1 Development of the Investigator’s Brochure

The sponsor ensures an IB is prepared and updated. In investigator-initiated trials, the sponsor-investigator must ascertain the availability of an IB from the product license holder. Current scientific information, including comprehensive product characteristics, should be incorporated. The IB should undergo regular reviews and updates in accordance with the sponsor's procedures, particularly when significant new information arises.

A.1.2 Reference Safety Information and Risk-Benefit Assessment

The IB contains essential reference safety information (RSI) for expedited reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). It facilitates clinical management by presenting objective and balanced risk-benefit assessments. The RSI and overall IB content must be reviewed and approved by relevant medical and scientific personnel.

A.2 General Considerations

The IB should clearly document:
