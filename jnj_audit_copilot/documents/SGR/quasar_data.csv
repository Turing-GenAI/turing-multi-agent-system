On 12 SEP 2023 a regulatory manager, from ICON, submitted a letter to the health authority, ANMAT, in Argentina to notify them that three sites on the 17000139BLC3001 (SunRIse 2) study (outsourced study) did not fulfill the commitment letter’s requirement to conduct Tuberculosis Skin Testing at screening. Background: A Janssen QA site audit was conducted at site S71-AR10009 from 11 JUL – 18 JUL 2023. The auditor discovered an ANMAT commitment letter signed by the PI, SRP, and GTL dated 26 JUL 2021. The commitment had required the investigators to perform additional assessments that were not part of the protocol amendment 2 at the time. Protocol amendment 2 incorporated all the assessments listed on the commitment letter (i.e. pregnancy exams, HIV and HEP A and B at screening), except for TB Skin Test at Screening which is utilized to rule out Tuberculosis. All SunRIse 2 sites located within Argentina must sign the ANMAT commitment letter. Currently there are 10 sites open in Argentina. The commitment letter requires additional assessments outside the protocol. The implementation of a HA commitment letter should have triggered the study team to implement updates to study specific guidance documents and system updates for sites within Argentina (i.e., protocol amendment, monitoring guidelines, or eCRF) to ensure that sites were complying to the required additional assessments, specifically TB skin test at screening. The other assessments required under the ANMAT commitment letter are covered within the protocol (i.e., pregnancy exams, HIV and HEP A and B at screening). However, the TB skin test was an assessment done outside of the protocol requirements. TB Skin testing at screening is not a requirement of the current protocol amendment 3 which states Exclusion #30 that 'Must not have active tuberculosis.' The protocol does not require a specific assessment to rule out tuberculosis. ICON site management conducted reviews on all sites in Argentina because of this audit finding on Site S71-AR10009. It was determined that 3 Sites out of 10 sites did not conduct the TB Screen testing at screening. The following sites failed to conduct TB Skin Tests: S71-AR10010 enrolled 2 patients; Site S71-AR10009 enrolled 16 patients, and S71-AR10004 enrolled 1 patient. Site S71-AR10009 used a CT scan instead to assess for presence of Tuberculosis. TB Skin testing is not a requirement of the current protocol amendment 3, which states on Exclusion #30, that 'Must not have active tuberculosis.' The protocol does not require a specific assessment to rule out tuberculosis. Investigators are expected to rely on patient reporting on active medical conditions, conduct further testing to rule out TB, and confirm absence of TB based on their clinical assessment. Impact: There were 3 sites that had not been following the MOH Commitment letter and failed to conduct TB Skin Tests: S71-AR10010 enrolled 2 patients; Site S71-AR10009 enrolled 16 patients, and S71-AR10004 enrolled 1 patient. The SRP’s assessment (26 SEP 2023) of impact is there is no risk to patient safety if TB Skin test was not done. Medical History, a complete Physical Exam, Hematology, Blood Chemistry, Urinalysis and CT/MRI scans with contrast of chest, abdomen, and Pelvis were performed at screening which would indicate presence of active Tuberculosis. If a patient with active TB is enrolled in the study, there is a potential they may infect others. In addition, TB exacerbation has been observed in patients receiving PD-(L)-1 inhibitors as well as those receiving systemic chemotherapy. The above-mentioned screening exams are frequently repeated during conduct of the study and have very high sensitivity for detection of potential reactivation of latent TB.",14

The audit was performed in Monterrey, Mexico on 12-14 Mar 2024. The auditor noted significant non-compliances at the site resulting in a Critical Observation focused on lack of Principal Investigator (PI) oversight resulting in several issues related to delegation, training, ICF, filing/study documents review, compliance with local Ethics Committee PD and SUSAR submission timelines, SUSAR reviews and IP. Background: The Study 17000139BLC3001 is a phase 3 study, to assess the efficacy of TAR-200 in combination with Cetrelimab versus concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in participants with Muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (MIBC) of the bladder who are not receiving radical cystectomy. The audited Site S71-MX10004 was opened on 25Nov21 and has screened 21 participants starting 08Apr22 (first subject screened), and has enrolled 10 participants. Issue description: • The site staff, including study coordinators, pharmacists, sub-investigators, and nurses, were performing study procedures without the required study training. The pharmacist did not have the necessary credentials, and there were errors in the preparation and administration of investigational products including the usage of outdated forms. • Delays occurred in obtaining reconsent from study participants for multiple versions for several months, and there were issues with documentation process. • Delegation log was updated after the announcement of the audit, with numerous changes without evidence of training in some cases. • Urological procedures were performed by partner institutions, leading to concerns about data completeness since only summaries are provided and not the original source. • Protocol deviations and safety reports were not handled according to required timelines outlined by their local Ethics Committee. • There were delays in reviewing study documents and SUSAR (instances were reviewed 1 year later), and not all necessary training was completed in a timely manner. • Site uses a platform with username and password for the generation of source documents, which they print and sign for the medical chart, with no procedure to explain how it should be handled.

LPLV for this study happened on 13MAY2022. The study results were taken offline on 25MAR2024 as an immediate containment action. Steps were also initiated to investigate the cause(s) of the issue. Upon initial review the most probable cause has been identified as an error at CCMO since the HA published the data with a deferral in place. The clinical study report synopsis was published on the same day that the submission was done, 21FEB-2023. At this time there is no evidence that J&J Innovative Medicine caused or contributed to the cause of the issue.",7

On 12 SEP 2023 a regulatory manager, from ICON, submitted a letter to the health authority, ANMAT, in Argentina to notify them that three sites on the 17000139BLC3001 (SunRIse 2) study (outsourced study) did not fulfill the commitment letter’s requirement to conduct Tuberculosis Skin Testing at screening. Background: A Janssen QA site audit was conducted at site S71-AR10009 from 11 JUL – 18 JUL 2023. The auditor discovered an ANMAT commitment letter signed by the PI, SRP, and GTL dated 26 JUL 2021. The commitment had required the investigators to perform additional assessments that were not part of the protocol amendment 2 at the time. Protocol amendment 2 incorporated all the assessments listed on the commitment letter (i.e. pregnancy exams, HIV and HEP A and B at screening), except for TB Skin Test at Screening which is utilized to rule out Tuberculosis. All SunRIse 2 sites located within Argentina must sign the ANMAT commitment letter. Currently there are 10 sites open in Argentina. The commitment letter requires additional assessments outside the protocol. The implementation of a HA commitment letter should have triggered the study team to implement updates to study specific guidance documents and system updates for sites within Argentina (i.e., protocol amendment, monitoring guidelines, or eCRF) to ensure that sites were complying to the required additional assessments, specifically TB skin test at screening. The other assessments required under the ANMAT commitment letter are covered within the protocol (i.e., pregnancy exams, HIV and HEP A and B at screening). However, the TB skin test was an assessment done outside of the protocol requirements. TB Skin testing at screening is not a requirement of the current protocol amendment 3 which states Exclusion #30 that 'Must not have active tuberculosis.' The protocol does not require a specific assessment to rule out tuberculosis. ICON site management conducted reviews on all sites in Argentina because of this audit finding on Site S71-AR10009. It was determined that 3 Sites out of 10 sites did not conduct the TB Screen testing at screening. The following sites failed to conduct TB Skin Tests: S71-AR10010 enrolled 2 patients; Site S71-AR10009 enrolled 16 patients, and S71-AR10004 enrolled 1 patient. Site S71-AR10009 used a CT scan instead to assess for presence of Tuberculosis. TB Skin testing is not a requirement of the current protocol amendment 3, which states on Exclusion #30, that 'Must not have active tuberculosis.' The protocol does not require a specific assessment to rule out tuberculosis. Investigators are expected to rely on patient reporting on active medical conditions, conduct further testing to rule out TB, and confirm absence of TB based on their clinical assessment. Impact: There were 3 sites that had not been following the MOH Commitment letter and failed to conduct TB Skin Tests: S71-AR10010 enrolled 2 patients; Site S71-AR10009 enrolled 16 patients, and S71-AR10004 enrolled 1 patient. The SRP’s assessment (26 SEP 2023) of impact is there is no risk to patient safety if TB Skin test was not done. Medical History, a complete Physical Exam, Hematology, Blood Chemistry, Urinalysis and CT/MRI scans with contrast of chest, abdomen, and Pelvis were performed at screening which would indicate presence of active Tuberculosis. If a patient with active TB is enrolled in the study, there is a potential they may infect others. In addition, TB exacerbation has been observed in patients receiving PD-(L)-1 inhibitors as well as those receiving systemic chemotherapy. The above-mentioned screening exams are frequently repeated during conduct of the study and have very high sensitivity for detection of potential reactivation of latent TB.",5

The audit was performed in Monterrey, Mexico on 12-14 Mar 2024. The auditor noted significant non-compliances at the site resulting in a Critical Observation focused on lack of Principal Investigator (PI) oversight resulting in several issues related to delegation, training, ICF, filing/study documents review, compliance with local Ethics Committee PD and SUSAR submission timelines, SUSAR reviews and IP. Background: The Study 17000139BLC3001 is a phase 3 study, to assess the efficacy of TAR-200 in combination with Cetrelimab versus concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in participants with Muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (MIBC) of the bladder who are not receiving radical cystectomy. The audited Site S71-MX10004 was opened on 25Nov21 and has screened 21 participants starting 08Apr22 (first subject screened), and has enrolled 10 participants. Issue description: • The site staff, including study coordinators, pharmacists, sub-investigators, and nurses, were performing study procedures without the required study training. The pharmacist did not have the necessary credentials, and there were errors in the preparation and administration of investigational products including the usage of outdated forms. • Delays occurred in obtaining reconsent from study participants for multiple versions for several months, and there were issues with documentation process. • Delegation log was updated after the announcement of the audit, with numerous changes without evidence of training in some cases. • Urological procedures were performed by partner institutions, leading to concerns about data completeness since only summaries are provided and not the original source. • Protocol deviations and safety reports were not handled according to required timelines outlined by their local Ethics Committee. • There were delays in reviewing study documents and SUSAR (instances were reviewed 1 year later), and not all necessary training was completed in a timely manner. • Site uses a platform with username and password for the generation of source documents, which they print and sign for the medical chart, with no procedure to explain how it should be handled. During the audit, access or over-the-shoulder view was not provided to the auditor to establish if it is an electronic medical records (EMR) system or not.",8

Per the Criminal Complaint, the site ceased operations in late 2019 after its owner and certain other staff were indicted and arrested on charges related to healthcare fraud and money laundering. The FBI alleges, among other things, that Dr. Hernandez exceeded authorized prescribing limits for Buprenorphine to opioid-addicted patients and used patients' insurance information to obtain reimbursements which otherwise would not have been permitted. Dr. Hernandez also participated in the following closed trials at Premier Clinical Research: 42847922MDD2002: screened 27 subjects, enrolled 10; 64565111OBE2002: screened 13 subjects, enrolled 9.

Background: A Janssen QA site audit was conducted at site S71-AR10009 from 11 JUL – 18 JUL 2023. The auditor discovered an ANMAT commitment letter signed by the PI, SRP, and GTL dated 26 JUL 2021. The commitment had required the investigators to perform additional assessments that were not part of the protocol amendment 2 at the time. Protocol amendment 2 incorporated all the assessments listed on the commitment letter (i.e. pregnancy exams, HIV and HEP A and B at screening), except for TB Skin Test at Screening which is utilized to rule out Tuberculosis. All SunRIse 2 sites located within Argentina must sign the ANMAT commitment letter. Currently there are 10 sites open in Argentina.

The implementation of a HA commitment letter should have triggered the study team to implement updates to study specific guidance documents and system updates for sites within Argentina (i.e., protocol amendment, monitoring guidelines, or eCRF) to ensure that sites were complying to the required additional assessments, specifically TB skin test at screening. The other assessments required under the ANMAT commitment letter are covered within the protocol (i.e., pregnancy exams, HIV and HEP A and B at screening). However, the TB skin test was an assessment done outside of the protocol requirements. TB Skin testing at screening is not a requirement of the current protocol amendment 3 which states Exclusion #30 that 'Must not have active tuberculosis.'

It was determined that 3 Sites out of 10 sites did not conduct the TB Screen testing at screening. The following sites failed to conduct TB Skin Tests: S71-AR10010 enrolled 2 patients; Site S71-AR10009 enrolled 16 patients, and S71-AR10004 enrolled 1 patient.

Background: A Janssen QA site audit was conducted at site S71-AR10009 from 11 JUL – 18 JUL 2023. The auditor discovered an ANMAT commitment letter signed by the PI, SRP, and GTL dated 26 JUL 2021. The commitment had required the investigators to perform additional assessments that were not part of the protocol amendment 2 at the time. Protocol amendment 2 incorporated all the assessments listed on the commitment letter (i.e. pregnancy exams, HIV and HEP A and B at screening), except for TB Skin Test at Screening which is utilized to rule out Tuberculosis. All SunRIse 2 sites located within Argentina must sign the ANMAT commitment letter. Currently there are 10 sites open in Argentina. The commitment letter requires additional assessments outside the protocol. The implementation of a HA commitment letter should have triggered the study team to implement updates to study specific guidance documents and system updates for sites within Argentina (i.e., protocol amendment, monitoring guidelines, or eCRF) to ensure that sites were complying to the required additional assessments, specifically TB skin test at screening. The other assessments required under the ANMAT commitment letter are covered within the protocol (i.e., pregnancy exams, HIV and HEP A and B at screening). However, the TB skin test was an assessment done outside of the protocol requirements. TB Skin testing at screening is not a requirement of the current protocol amendment 3 which states Exclusion #30 that 'Must not have active tuberculosis.' The protocol does not require a specific assessment to rule out tuberculosis. ICON site management conducted reviews on all sites in Argentina because of this audit finding on Site S71-AR10009. It was determined that 3 Sites out of 10 sites did not conduct the TB Screen testing at screening. The following sites failed to conduct TB Skin Tests: S71-AR10010 enrolled 2 patients; Site S71-AR10009 enrolled 16 patients, and S71-AR10004 enrolled 1 patient. Site S71-AR10009 used a CT scan instead to assess for presence of Tuberculosis. TB Skin testing is not a requirement of the current protocol amendment 3, which states on Exclusion #30, that 'Must not have active tuberculosis.' The protocol does not require a specific assessment to rule out tuberculosis. Investigators are expected to rely on patient reporting on active medical conditions, conduct further testing to rule out TB, and confirm absence of TB based on their clinical assessment. Impact: There were 3 sites that had not been following the MOH Commitment letter and failed to conduct TB Skin Tests: S71-AR10010 enrolled 2 patients; Site S71-AR10009 enrolled 16 patients, and S71-AR10004 enrolled 1 patient. The SRP’s assessment (26 SEP 2023) of impact is there is no risk to patient safety if TB Skin test was not done. Medical History, a complete Physical Exam, Hematology, Blood Chemistry, Urinalysis and CT/MRI scans with contrast of chest, abdomen, and Pelvis were performed at screening which would indicate presence of active Tuberculosis. If a patient with active TB is enrolled in the study, there is a potential they may infect others. In addition, TB exacerbation has been observed in patients receiving PD-(L)-1 inhibitors as well as those receiving systemic chemotherapy. The above-mentioned screening exams are frequently repeated during conduct of the study and have very high sensitivity for detection of potential reactivation of latent TB.",9

However, the TB skin test was an assessment done outside of the protocol requirements. TB Skin testing at screening is not a requirement of the current protocol amendment 3 which states Exclusion #30 that 'Must not have active tuberculosis.' The protocol does not require a specific assessment to rule out tuberculosis. ICON site management conducted reviews on all sites in Argentina because of this audit finding on Site S71-AR10009. It was determined that 3 Sites out of 10 sites did not conduct the TB Screen testing at screening. The following sites failed to conduct TB Skin Tests: S71-AR10010 enrolled 2 patients; Site S71-AR10009 enrolled 16 patients, and S71-AR10004 enrolled 1 patient. Site S71-AR10009 used a CT scan instead to assess for presence of Tuberculosis. TB Skin testing is not a requirement of the current protocol amendment 3, which states on Exclusion #30, that 'Must not have active tuberculosis.' The protocol does not require a specific assessment to rule out tuberculosis. Investigators are expected to rely on patient reporting on active medical conditions, conduct further testing to rule out TB, and confirm absence of TB based on their clinical assessment. Impact: There were 3 sites that had not been following the MOH Commitment letter and failed to conduct TB Skin Tests: S71-AR10010 enrolled 2 patients; Site S71-AR10009 enrolled 16 patients, and S71-AR10004 enrolled 1 patient. The SRP’s assessment (26 SEP 2023) of impact is there is no risk to patient safety if TB Skin test was not done. Medical History, a complete Physical Exam, Hematology, Blood Chemistry, Urinalysis and CT/MRI scans with contrast of chest, abdomen, and Pelvis were performed at screening which would indicate presence of active Tuberculosis. If a patient with active TB is enrolled in the study, there is a potential they may infect others. In addition, TB exacerbation has been observed in patients receiving PD-(L)-1 inhibitors as well as those receiving systemic chemotherapy. The above-mentioned screening exams are frequently repeated during conduct of the study and have very high sensitivity for detection of potential reactivation of latent TB.",9
90014496LYM1001,AUD-001792,,Other,0,3,4,6,Routine,Major,"Privileged and Confidential: In follow-up to the escalation REACT # 2240359 issued on 21-Mar-2023, a for-cause clinical investigator site audit for Seltorexant study 42847922MDD3001 at the site of Dr. Carlos Perez (Site R88-US10044 Miami Florida) was initiated. The audit was performed under privilege at the direction of the J&J Law Department. A Critical Observation was identified during the audit related to inadequate informed consent processes, including nine (9) missing informed consent forms for screen failures. In addition, study participant data (Actigraphy and ePRO) were collected and transferred to the External Service Providers without documented evidence of participants' consent or after their screen failure date (ranging from 5 days to 70 days). Additional significant audit observations related to the inadequacy of source documents/data (including SCID-CT rating) were confirmed during the QA Audit. More specific details are included in the audit report. Dr. Perez screened 39 trial participants, enrolled 7 and 32 were deemed screen failures (including cases of screen failure due to consent withdrawal).",7
